Dear Mercy,

I hope this letter reaches you swiftly, as there’s no time to waste. I write to you with an urgent warning that cannot be delayed—an attack is imminent, and I fear it will strike Atlanta soon.

Sources I trust have confirmed that a group of trolls is preparing to launch an assault on the city within the next few days. These creatures are not like anything we’ve faced before; they are vicious, cunning, and relentless. Their numbers are growing, and they’re driven by a single purpose—destruction.

I need you to be on high alert. Warn everyone you can, and prepare your defenses. Ensure that those who are vulnerable are moved to safety, and that the city’s security forces are ready to respond. These trolls are drawn to chaos and fear, so we must not let them divide or demoralize us.

I wish I could be there to help, but my hands are tied dealing with another situation up north. However, I trust your judgment and leadership, Mercy. You’ve always been the calm in the storm, and I know you’ll do everything in your power to protect those you care about.

Stay vigilant, stay strong, and remember—you’re not alone in this fight. I’ll send whatever reinforcements I can as soon as possible. Until then, take care of yourself and be prepared for anything.

With all my best,

Adam
